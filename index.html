      <h2>What is the Beer Fund?</h2>
      <p>Friday afternoon at Threespot is a time to celebrate a week of hard work - and what better way to do that than a cold brew in hand. Those who wish to partake make donations to our Beer Fund, and our current Chief Beer Officer (Jes Gundy) makes sure we all stay supplied.</p>
      <p>What does a good contribution look like? It varies depending on how much you drink. Only need one beer come Friday? $10 should set you straight for a month. Find yourself frequently reaching for a second? $20 might be a more appropriate amount.</p>
      <h2>Beerfund 2.0</h2>
      <p>With the redesign of the beer fund comes a new system for tracking donations. Here's how it breaks down.</p>
      <p>All donors in good standing are posted on the Donors List above. Whenever you make a donation, your name gets up on the board. The bigger the donation - the longer your name stays up. Once your name comes down off the list, it's time to pitch in again.</p>
      <p>Our top level donors are marked with the thumbs up symbol by their name. They donate the most and keep the suds flowing for all of us. Give them a pat on the back when you see them! In contrast, those who are seen partaking while their name is absent from the list are Moochers, and should be vigorously frowned at and whispered about.</p>
